## 🚀 What This Does

- 🧠 **Auto-detects your project** - tech stack, patterns, file structure
- 🔧 **Optimizes messy requests** - "fix the modal thing" → structured implementation plan  
- ✅ **Quality gates** - won't complete tasks until code compiles and tests pass
- 📚 **Full documentation context** - 784 entries of Claude Code best practices
- 🎯 **Zero setup** - just drop in your project and start coding

## 🎬 Quick Demo

**Before**: "The modal is weird and doesn't close sometimes"

**After**: 
```
🔧 Let me help optimize this request

What I understood: Modal closing issue with potential state management problems

I need to clarify:
1. Which modal component file should I examine?
2. What user actions trigger the issue?
3. Are there console errors when this happens?

Suggested approach:
1. Analyze modal component state management
2. Check useEffect dependencies
3. Implement proper cleanup
4. Test closing behavior

Should I proceed with this approach?
```
